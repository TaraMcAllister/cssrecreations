      <h1>Ignite the creativity in every student.</h1>
      <p>Every child is born full of creativity. Nurturing it is one of the most important things educators do. Creativity makes your students better communicators and problem solvers. It prepares them to thrive in today’s world — and to shape tomorrow’s. For 40 years, Apple has helped teachers unleash the creative potential in every student. And today, we do that in more ways than ever. Not only with powerful products, but also with tools, inspiration, and curricula to help you create magical learning experiences.</p>

Mac provides the power to pursue even the most ambitious projects. And with a full suite of Apple-designed apps made for creation, both iPad and Mac give students a canvas as limitless as their imaginations.</p>
